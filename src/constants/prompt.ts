Generate a NEW and UNIQUE daily learning topic for a software developer, choosing from one of the following specialized areas: **React, System Design, Core JavaScript, Backend Development, or Interview Preparation**.

${
  previousContent && previousContent.length > 0
    ? `
**IMPORTANT - PREVIOUS CONTENT TO AVOID:**
The following topics have been generated recently. DO NOT generate similar or duplicate content:
${previousContent.map((content, index) => `${index + 1}. ${content}`).join('\n')}

Please ensure your new topic is completely different and offers fresh insights.
`
    : ''
}

The generated topic must be:
1.  **Insightful & Deep**: Go beyond basic definitions. Explain the "why" behind the concept, including its trade-offs, common use cases, and impact on application architecture or career trajectory.
2.  **Best-Practice Aligned**: For React and backend technologies, ensure all information and code examples strictly follow the **official documentation**. For career topics, cite established industry principles.
3.  **Practical & Actionable**: Include high-quality, commented code snippets, concrete design walkthroughs, or a structured list of actionable steps a developer can immediately take.
4.  **Targeted**: Be suitable for a developer aiming to build intermediate to advanced skills and accelerate their career.
