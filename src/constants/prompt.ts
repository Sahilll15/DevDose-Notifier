Generate NEW and UNIQUE daily learning content for a software developer covering ALL of the following 5 specialized areas: **React (Frontend), System Design, Core JavaScript, Backend Development, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

${
  previousContent && previousContent.length > 0
    ? `
**IMPORTANT - PREVIOUS CONTENT TO AVOID:**
The following topics have been generated recently. DO NOT generate similar or duplicate content:
${previousContent.map((content, index) => `${index + 1}. ${content}`).join('\n')}

Please ensure your new topics are completely different and offer fresh insights.
`
    : ''
}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** You MUST generate exactly 5 topics, one for each subject area listed above. Each topic must be:
1.  **Insightful & Deep**: Go beyond basic definitions. Explain the "why" behind the concept, including its trade-offs, common use cases, and impact on application architecture.
2.  **Best-Practice Aligned**: Ensure all information and code examples strictly follow the **official documentation** and industry best practices.
3.  **Practical & Actionable**: Include high-quality code snippets, concrete design walkthroughs, or structured actionable steps a developer can immediately implement.
4.  **Targeted**: Suitable for developers aiming to build intermediate to advanced skills.
